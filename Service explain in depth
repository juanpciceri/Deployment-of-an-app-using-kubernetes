$ kubectl get services

NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes    ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        1d
web-service   NodePort    10.110.47.84   <none>        80:31074/TCP   22s

Our web-service is now created and its ClusterIP is 10.110.47.84. In the PORT(S)section, we see a mapping of 80:31074, which means that we have reserved a static port 31074 on the node. If we connect to the node on that port, our requests will be proxied to the ClusterIP on port 80.

It is not necessary to create the Deployment first, and the Service after. They can be created in any order. A Service will find and connect Pods based on the Selector.

To get more details about the Service, we can use the kubectl describe command, as in the following example:
web-service uses app=nginx as a Selector to logically group our three Pods, which are listed as endpoints. When a request reaches our Service, it will be served by one of the Pods listed in the Endpoints section.
